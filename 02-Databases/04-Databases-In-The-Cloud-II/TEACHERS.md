To test the "partitions & clusters" challenge, you will have to create an '*analysis'* dataset and ingest the data from the bucket into a *flights* table. Otherwise the students' scripts won't run.

Results for questions 10 & 11 have to be the same than the ones of the students, as we are not using a time dependent partitioning.

In the rest of this challenge, the most important aspect is the partition (PARTITION BY) and clustering (CLUSTER BY) logic used. It has to be similar to the solution proposed.

## Background & Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to create your own report and share it with your teacher.

## Import file

Create a new Power BI report, and load the data from this file:

[Skyscrapers.csv](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bi-data/Skyscrapers.csv)

## Specs

Now put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst 👨‍💻

Our client is an **architectural firm** and has ordered a market study concerning the tallests buildings in the world in order to find opportunities (e.g where/how they are mostly built, which usage...) 🏙

Let's create a report for this firm with two views: 

1. a global view (e.g representing the number of buildings per country, a construction history, materials used over the years, evolution of the usage, a geographical overview...)
2. a detail view, where the final user will be able to select a country and will have specific information (e.g city repartition, some KPIs like max/average height, oldest building...)

In order to complete this task, we recommend the following steps:

1. Clean the data
2. Create your own business report
3. Format your report
4. Save your report as NAME_FIRSTNAME_skyscraper_report
5. Publish it

Good luck! 🍀

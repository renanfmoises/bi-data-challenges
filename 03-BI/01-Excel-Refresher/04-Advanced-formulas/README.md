## Background & Objectives

Use your knowledge to fill a table based on a dataset. You may need to do some research, so do not jump on the solution!

## Let's play strong ðŸ˜Ž

Go to `Challenge_4` and complete the table with the right formula (just a unique one you're gonna fill down and right).

It will let you have the average `QualityCheck` value per month and employee.

â†’ Dataset is on columns A to C.

- Hint 1 (only if needed!)ðŸ’¡

    An `AVERAGEIFS` formula with 3 criteria could be useful... don't forget the constraints!

- Hint 2 ðŸ’¡

    Check the `EDATE` formula on the web.

- Hint 3ðŸ’¡

    Got errors instead of zeros ? Use `IFERROR`!

Once done, find a way to display the value corresponding to chosen Employee and Month in lists: your colleague look forward to using this report!

Check `challenge_4_solution`.

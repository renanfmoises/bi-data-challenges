The mall director loved your metrics (yeepee!)

It's time to fine tune how it looks likes and improve readability.

## Background & Objectives

Discover how to showcase peculiar elements in your analysis.

## Highlight elements

In the `order-details` tab:

- Filter that table to only keep **july 2016** data
- Use a colour scale on `Revenue`: use a **3-colour scale** (0, 50, max value)
- Highlight margin % upper than 150% in **yellow ðŸŸ¡**
- Highlight margin % lower than 100% in **red** ðŸ”´
- Create a column named `Validation`
    - If margin % is upper than 150%, print "Great"
    - If margin % lower than 100%, print "Just Ok"
    - Otherwise, print "Good"
- Hint ðŸ’¡

    You'll have to nest two `IF` together!

    Note how this new formula behaves in an Excel Table.

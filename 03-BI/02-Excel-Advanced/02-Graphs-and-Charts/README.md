## Background & Objectives

Practice the use of important Excel charts.

## Using charts

Let's use graphs based on our newly designed Pivot Tables.

Create a new sheet and give this tab the name `Report`.

Here are the charts we want to display on our analysis `Report`. Your goal is to replicate them using `Charts Tables` sheet.

**Chart 1:**

**Chart 5:**

This one is a bit special! See the dropdown lists? It allows you to choose the displayed elements.

To do that, use a chart on the Pivot Table you created before.

Unhide `challenge_2_report` tab to check your charts.

## Be creative!

Got every charts on your report ? Great!

Go to Page Layout > Size > Letter. A dotted border is now displayed. It represents the content included in a printed report.

Let's imagine the director needs a one page report for its strategic committee. Go on and create that report, all graphs must fit in it! Here's an example of how it could look like.

There is no specific answer, just play with Excel and get a bit more familiar ðŸ˜Ž

Once finished, save this tab as PDF and have a look on the resulting report. Share your creation with the class on your batch's Slack channel!

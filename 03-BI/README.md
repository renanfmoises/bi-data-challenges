This BI module brings Big Data together in one place!

We will learn how to use MS Excel for exploring and preparing the data, and PowerQuery for wrangling and cleaning the data.

Then we will learn how to answer critical business questions by producing interactive visualisations, producing reports.

While in comparison Excel starts to slow down when dealing with large models, Power BI is optimised to deal with tables in excess of 100 million records without breaking a sweat.

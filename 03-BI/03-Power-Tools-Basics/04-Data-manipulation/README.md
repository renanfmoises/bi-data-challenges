## Background & Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to learn how to manipulate date format.

## Import file

Create a new Power BI report, and load the data from this file:

[First half.xlsx](assets/First_half.xlsx)

![assets/Untitled.png](assets/Untitled.png)

<details><summary markdown='span'>Hint ðŸ’¡
</summary>
  - Drop 1st top row
  - Use first row as headers
  - Name 1st column â‡’ Task
</details>

## Data cleaning

Use Query Editor to enrich your data:

- Unpivot the monthly data

- Add a conditional column, returning the correct `Month number` for each row (do the corresponding for the 12 months, it will be useful for the rest of this challenge)
- Now, we want to create a real datetime object for this column. Let's say these values were taken the 1st day of each month in 2020. Create a new column `Date task` with a date format.

<details><summary markdown='span'>Hint ðŸ’¡
</summary>
  - Create an aggregated column you will transform in date format
  - `Date task = "01/" & [Month number] & "/2020"`
</details>

## Data visualization

Once your data is ok, bring it back into your Power BI report, and use it to create some chart.

- We want to visualize `the costs per month and per task` in a column chart.

    âš  As you can notice, your "Date task" column is divided into 4 parts (Year/Quarter/Month/Day). This notion will be covered in another course unit.

    For this challenge, just switch from "Date Hierarchy" to "Date task" to display the whole date.

## Data automation

We've just received the second half values for this year and we want to display the exact same chart.

In order to refresh your data automatically, you have two ways for a flat file:

1. Name this new file with the **exact** designation of your first import and replace it in the same folder
2. Change the path in your datasource settings

    ![assets/Untitled%205.png](assets/Untitled%205.png)

Then refresh your data. Which method do you prefer?!

Save your file as **Date manipulation**. ðŸ’¾
